About Me
======
Hi, Iâ€™m Jaewon Chu, a 3rd-year M.S & Ph.D integrated student at Korea University Computer Science and Engineering department, conducting research at the Machine Learning and Vision Lab (MLV) under the supervision of [professor Hyunwoo J. Kim](https://www.hyunwoojkim.com/).

I am broadly interested in <strong>optimizing generative AI to better serve human needs.</strong> My research focuses on the intersection of generative models and black-box optimization methods, including Bayesian Optimization, Neural Bandits, and Reinforcement Learning. Human needs are often expressed as black-box functionsâ€”such as molecule properties or the accuracy of API-LLMs (*e.g.,* GPT, Claude, Gemini)â€”and I explores to make generative models to produce outputs that meet these needs by black-box optimization.

ðŸ“¢ _<u>I am also actively seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my research skills and contribute to impactful projects.</u>_
